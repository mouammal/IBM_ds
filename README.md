# IBM Capstone Project : Wining Space Race with Data Science 

Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 Can recover the first stage. 
Sometimes the first stage does not land.  Sometimes it will crash as shown in this clip. 
Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer.

In this capstone, I will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket  company.  
Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk !

Goal : 
1. Determine the price of each launch by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards.  
2. Determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage by determining if the first stage will land successfully,
   train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX  will reuse the first stage.
   
## Methodology :

1. Data Collection (API & Webscraping)
2. Data Wrangling 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Data Viz & SQL)
4. Interactive Visual Analytics (Folium & Dash)
5. Predictive Analysis (ML Predictions)
